## Apploi:

  - The idea was to create a dashboard similar to what a recruiter would see upon logging into a dashboard.
  - Design Principles: https://medium.com/@janelle.wg/atomic-design-pattern-how-to-structure-your-react-application-2bb4d9ca5f97
  - Component Design: https://material-ui.com/
  - The design is not that great. If I would have spent a little more time create wireframes with Sketch, or Storybook, the design would be much better.
  - Typically, I would create multiple branches defining a feature/story within that branch. For example, if I wanted to implement react-router into my app. Typically, I would create a branch off of the dev branch named, implement-react-router. When the implement-react-router branch would be considered complete, it would then be merged back into dev branch.

### To-do's: 
  - Implement error handling.
  - 100% responsive.
  - Add real API.
  - Loading screens.
